This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Chrome extension, **Request Thru**.

## 2. Data Collection and Usage

We **do not** collect personally identifiable information from users. However, we process network requests to:

These permissions are strictly used to enhance browsing functionality and **not** for tracking users.

We may retrieve API data from external services, but we do not share user data with these services. The extension operates solely within the browser.

## 5. Data Security

- No data is stored externally.
- We do not sell or share any user-related data.
- Any future updates will comply with strict security standards.
